# Code of Conduct

It's simple - we promote empathy, inclusivity, and patience. If you can't follow that, leave.

I have no patience for anyone who ever voted for Trump, or anyone who considers themselves conservative or centrist in the US. Go join Redot, you Nazi.

## ðŸš« We Don't Tolerate

- Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind
- Gatekeeping or dismissive behavior
- Acting like an elitist jackass
- Intentionally disrupting others' efforts

## âœ… We Encourage

- Curiosity and mutual respect
- LGBTQ+ and diverse voices
- Honest feedback, kindly delivered
- Thoughtful technical and creative contributions

## ðŸ§¹ Consequences

If you act like a jerk, you're out. No drama. No debate.
