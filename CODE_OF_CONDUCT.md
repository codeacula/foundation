# 🏳️‍🌈 CODE OF CONDUCT

It's simple - we promote empathy, inclusivity, and patience. If you can't follow that, leave.

I have no patience for anyone who ever voted for Trump or anyone who considers themselves conservative or centrist in the US. Go join Redot, you Nazi.

Similarly, if you're incapable of not seeing human rights as political, you don't need to be here. There's nothing tolerant about me, and I'm not going to pretend there is. Human rights are inherent in all of us. Trans rights are human rights. ACAB.

## 🚫 We Don't Tolerate

- Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind [^1]
- Gatekeeping or dismissive behavior
- Acting like an elitist jackass
- Intentionally disrupting others' efforts

## ✅ We Encourage

- Curiosity and mutual respect
- LGBTQ+ (El Jibble) and diverse voices
- Honest feedback, kindly delivered
- Thoughtful technical and creative contributions

## 🧹 Consequences

If you act like a jerk, you're out. No drama. No debate.
