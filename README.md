# Foundation - Codeacula's Personal Setup

Foundation is meant to be a template repository for my main projects. The aim of Foundation is to provide the following:

- A standardized folder structure to easily organize projects
- Instructions for AI Agents
- A template to encourage lifelong documentation
- Documents to outline contributing, support, and community values
- A central location to store my common code

## DOCUMENTATION

This documentation is meant to be broken up so it's easy for both humans and AI to consume. Aside from specific documentation to support GitHub, all documentation should live inside the `/docs` folder. We use [Obsidian ](https://obsidian.md/) style markdown in the documentation.

If you'd like a starting place, [[docs/Index|Index]] has you covered.
